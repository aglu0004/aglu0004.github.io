            <h2>What is the Canadian Call of Duty League?</h2>
            <p>The Canadian Call of Duty League was an addition to bring high level eSports to Canada. This league operates at the professional Level and welcomes players ages 18-30. This league was introduced in January 2012, and since then has been evolving each year, both financially and in popularity. Currently the league holds six teams across the six Provinces, and within the next five years plans to introduce two more. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    The goal for this League is to continue growing not only in the Canada's provinces, but to reach all across Canada, the league accepts talents from all over Canada to play on any of the teams. The vision for the future is to have all games broadcasted to the nation, or at least across the cities that play host to one of the teams for all to experience and cheer their favorite team on from the comforts of their own home.
