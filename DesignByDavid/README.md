With my Portfolio Website, I wanted to take a clean and minimal look. How I went about creating this is by first ensuring I has a SVG file of my logo so that when the screen size got bigger it would maintain its quality. Neext I wanted to create my navigation, which consisted of my portfolio page and about me, and my logo would act as the home button. With my content and how it would fit across all three pages would be a one column grid for mobile devices and tablet, and a two column grid would be utilized for desktop. This grid system would be used to keep all content neatly organized and keeps the minimal theme present. The footer is a simple bar, that contains my brand (My full name). With coding this portfolio website, the main problems I ran into was creating the navigation bar. Having it switch from being below the logo, to it being ontop the page alongside the logi was tricky to figure out the correct code. To solve this I looked back back on old class content to figure out the right way to have both assets work alongside. 

What I really learned from creating this website is the style of websites I enjoy building, as well as the style that I think fits my personal brand. While having a minimalist look may result in not a much code as a huge website with intricate moving parts, but I belive it can do just as good or even better at attracting people to view it and interact with whats on the site.
